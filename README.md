this is the third homework for COSC 4370

Environment: I built this project using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019

#Creating the Vertex and Fragment Shaders, along with coding the main and camera
To be honest, this was more challenging than I expected. I knew about the graphics pipeline, but had no idea how to implement it in code.  I didn't even know how to create a .vs and .frag, thinking I had to download other programs to do the trick.  Eventually I figured out how, and began. The powerpoint on blackboard helped me get started, and soon I had a sort of idea how create uniforms and use them.  I found a couple of tutorials online that gave me some hints of how to create the phong reflection using ambient shade, diffuse shade, and specular shade.  I actually enjoyed playing around with the different numbers, testing out different appearances of the cube.  By the end of this, I had figured out how to pass info through parts of the graphic pipeline, starting at the vertex shader and transferring it to the fragment shader, and then out from there. 

Completing the main and camera parts of the code reminded me more of normal C++ coding than OpenGL coding.   It took some getting used to, considering I've never done anything using eular angles, plus it's been a little while since I took Calculus, but once I found some tutorials online that gave me a nudge in the right direction, I managed to complete them. This was where I set up the matrices that made the basis for the project.

#Final thoughts
I didn't enjoy this project as much as the second.  It was easier in terms of coding, but harder in terms of theory.  It took lots of googling, asking questions, and research into completing it. I had never used any sort of files before instead of .h's and .cpp's, so it was nice to try something new. It would be interesting, however, if we had to combine out hw2 and hw3.  Could be an interesting project.

I put the tutorials and materials that I used to help complete the code in my files.
